## What problem does CopySphere solve?
Currently, copyright law is broken and the system needs changing.

There are multiple aspects to this but the specific pain CopySphere aims to relieve is that
there are is no middle ground between the two main ways of doing community contribution. Either:

- A for-profit company controls everything. Usually this involves the company
owning a platform or IP to which they accept contributions to while having full control
about how revenue due to contributions is distributed. This tends to be heavily favored towards the company.
Most commonly in video game development,
people creating mods for a game stick to publishing their content for free
while only driving revenue to the original game creator.
The path to gain revenue for modders is often blocked and requires significant
investment to effectively re-implement the game that it is a mod on.
Another example would be the music and video industry and how it is difficult to publish
fair use remixes without needing to be or hire an expert in copyright law,
otherwise being under threat of having revenue cut off unfairly.

- Everything is free. This is often seen within Open Source communities.
These communities tend to have problems scaling. There is only so much time
people can spend without needing to worry about paying bills and it is difficult
to extract money from altering something that is published for free.

Another compounding factor is that it is not easy to change copyright law without
having to compete with lobbying power of large companies in US Congress.

## How does CopySphere solve the problems?
By having the copyright held by a central non-profit, (the CopySphere organization)
we can use standard contracts to encourage easy remixing of content
while also ensuring that reasonable monetary attribution is given.
This means that creators are empowered to create content that they
receive money for without needing to spend significant time and resources to establish
business relations with other content creators.

By establishing a this new system of copyright, we do not have to convince the minds
of legislators that this model is better before people gain the benefit of it.

## What defines reasonable attribution?
Foreword:
There is no objective answer to this question.
CopySphere depends on being a stable system where the goodwill of the many
can keep the greed and abuse of the few in check.

First, the person who registers their content makes the initial attribution statement.
    - There are guidelines for common examples of reasonable attribution.
    - TODO: notes to explain attribution
    - Attribution can only be to works which have been registered before the new content.

Other accounts may dispute the attribution by proposing their own statement.
TODO: community tribunal for scalability

Action may be taken against accounts which make statements that are judged to maliciously mis-attribute.


## FAQ

### Why a non-profit?
While a for-profit system might be able to archive certain metrics quicker,
it is fundamentally a untrustworthy system as the incentives lead to
the system being changed such that maximum value is extracted from it,
rater than there being.
As an example, the YouTube platform has contributed a great service but
in recent years has been trending to direct more value to Google rather
than encouraging high quality content[.](https://www.cartoonbrew.com/ideas-commentary/is-youtube-making-it-harder-for-animators-to-make-money-102408.html)
This is likely to continue until
there is so much adversarial sentiment from viewers/creators
until there is a equilibrium of people going to other platforms, which is not the ideal state.
We assert that a system where trust plays a central role
has to be structurally well aligned with its goal.

### How do I prevent controversial remixes of my content?
Some uses of content may be against the creators intent,
such as being included in rule34, gambling, or political speech.

CopySphere allows you to visibly redirect attribution coming from tagged sources to you, to a charity.
This allows you to show that you do not condone such uses and that you do not want to be seen as profiting off them.


### What content is not allowed?
Any content that would prevent the system from operating.
This includes, but is not limited to:
    - content that is illegal
    - content that includes intellectual property outside of the CopySphere
without due diligence on fair use
    - content that is too difficult to process by machine or people (spam / abuse)

### How will discovery of content work?
External for-profit third parties may use the API to surface
content in a way they see fit as long as they keep to the rules of
reasonable attribution.

### What about other forms of Intellectual Property?
Trademarks should not be registered as content.
This means that no content should include trademarks.
Account owners may indicate that they own a trademark to legitimize
the association of content and tagging with a company.

Patents target general forms of function and thus can not be specific content.

### Rounding
Due to resources being finite to in distributing funding,
rounding will happen when processing an attribution amount would cost CopySphere than processing that database entry.
Rounding will favor the party that has contributed more.


### How is the cut to CopySphere determined?
It is fundamentally a trade-off. A lower cut would imply:
    More money to creators which should encourage more content creation.
    More rounding
    Less resources to adjudicate disputes fairly.
    Less likely that CopySphere is stable against lawsuits from external parties.

Each year, all accounts may indicate on what they think is best.
Ultimately, the CopySphere organization has to be trusted to make this trade-off reasonably.
