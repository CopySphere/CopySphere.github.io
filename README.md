## What problem does CopySphere solve?
Currently, only two main ways of a community contributing to a project:

- TODO: FOSS
- TODO: For-profit controls everything.

Another problems is that it is not easy to change copyright without
having to compete with lobbying power of large companies in US Congress.

## How does CopySphere solve the problems?
By having the copyright held by a central non-profit, (the CopySphere organization)
we can use standard contracts to allow easy remixing of content
while also ensuring that reasonable monetary attribution is given.

## What defines reasonable attribution?
Foreword:
There is no objective answer to this question.
CopySphere depends on being a stable system where the goodwill of the many
can keep the greed and abuse of the few in check.

First, the person who registers their content makes the initial attribution statement.
    - There are guidelines for common examples of reasonable attribution.
    - TODO: notes to explain attribution
    - Attribution can only be to works which have been registered before the new content.

Other accounts may dispute the attribution by proposing their own statement.
TODO: community tribunal for scalability

Action may be taken against accounts which make statements that are judged to maliciously mis-attribute.


## FAQ

### Why a non-profit?
TODO: The most stable system.

### How do I prevent rule34 of my content?
CopySphere allows you to visibly redirect attribution from tagged sources

### What about other forms of Intellectual Property?
Trademarks should not be registered as content.
This means that no content should include trademarks.
Account owners may indicate that they own a trademark to legitimize
the association of content and tagging with a company.

Patents target general forms of function and thus can not be specific content.

### Rounding
Due to resources being finite to in distributing funding,
rounding will happen when processing an attribution amount would cost CopySphere than processing that database entry.
Rounding will favour the party that has contributed more.


### How is the cut to CopySphere determined?
It is fundamentally a tradeoff. A lower cut would imply:
    More money to creators which should encourage more content creation.
    More rounding
    Less resources to adjudicate disputes fairly.
    Less likely that CopySphere is stable against lawsuits from external parties.

Each year, all accounts may indicate on what they think is best.
Ultimately, the CopySphere organization has to be trusted to make this tradeoff reasonably.
